# About Me

Name: Ashish Kunthe

I am a full-stack developer focused on building scalable backend systems and AI-integrated applications. My core experience includes designing REST APIs, implementing authentication systems, structuring databases, and integrating large language models into real-world workflows.

---

## Technical Skills

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Node.js / Express
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- React
- JWT Authentication
- Zod Validation
- OpenAI API Integration

---

## Project Focus

This project demonstrates:

- Structured LLM integration with deterministic JSON output
- Backend-first system design
- Secure authentication and ownership validation
- Clean separation of Transcript and ActionItem models
- Input validation and defensive error handling
- Health monitoring for backend, database, and LLM

---

## Development Approach

- Designed database relationships intentionally (one-to-many: Transcript → ActionItems).
- Validated all LLM outputs before database insertion.
- Enforced ownership checks before updates and deletions.
- Prioritized clean architecture over unnecessary abstraction.
